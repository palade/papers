\f0\fs24 \cf0 again this paper identify clearly abut two SLA between saas pass and pass iaas\
\
good\
good idea to use ANN\
\
bad \
no mapping detail and seems like only consider performance
\f1 . It require very strict estimate of low level resource. It does not intend to be adaptive.\
\
"In [25], an online system based \
on closed loop feedback from application KPIs is used in order \
to drive the resource management. This is an ideal case when \
SLAs are not needed for reserving a priori the resources, but \
the application can adjust its own reservations, without \
consulting first with the IaaS provider" \
\
we can still consulting via supply demand theory rather than static SLA}
